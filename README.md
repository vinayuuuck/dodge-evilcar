# dodge-evilcar
Game made entirely from standard Python libraries (like Tkinter)

The premise of the game is to dodge the car coming at you from the other way by moving your own car left or right, and collect points along the way by colliding with the ghost(+10) or the wrench(+100).
However, the movement of all the objects coming at you is randomised, making it hard to figure where exactly they're going to be, increasing the risk of being hit by the titular evil car.

Movement: left and right arrow keys / a and d keys for moving left and right

Boss key: Ctrl-b

Pause: Ctrl-p

Cheat: semicolon(;) for +100 points

Quit: space
